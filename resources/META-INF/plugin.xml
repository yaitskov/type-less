      <p>
      The goal of this plugin is to relief the burden of Java programmer
      of pressing extra keys while typing and making coding more ergonomic.
      </p>

      <p>
      In two words it could be described as T9 plus auto-replace
      for the structured language with a context free grammar.
      </p>

      <p>So where is the burden?
      Character frequencies in Java differ from English. So even if you just inverse Shift key
      for a half dozen keys (like 9 0 - ,.) you will gain 4% less key to be pressed to write
      an average program in Java, but why do you need to think about Shift in a formal language?!
      </p>

      <p>
      IDE can figure out what did you want to input when you have pressed key "2" ("@" or "2").
      There are tons of information such as AST, Java types, and class hierarchies to accomplish this.
      </p>

      <p>
      At the current stage just key "2" has smart mapping.
      Rest subset of special characters have inverted Shift
      behavior plus auto-replace rules.
      See the table below.
      </p>

      <p>
      E.g. when you type <b>9</b> as usual <b>(</b> will be inserted
      and vice versa (<b>(</b> => <b>9</b>)
      </p>

      <table border="1" cellpadding="10">
      <tr><td>-</td><td>_</td></tr>
      <tr><td>9</td><td>(</td></tr>
      <tr><td>0</td><td>)</td></tr>
      <tr><td>[</td><td>{</td></tr>
      <tr><td>]</td><td>}</td></tr>
      <tr><td>'</td><td>"</td></tr>
      <tr><td>`</td><td>~</td></tr>
      <tr><td>\</td><td>|</td></tr>
      </table>

      <h4>Auto replace rules</h4>
      <p>Letter after @ is upper cased.</p>
      <p>Lambda delimiter of arguments and the body is recognized.</p>
      <p>Replace "{" with "[" right after letter or digit, and "}" after "["
         (Variable with array type like "String[]").</p>
      <p>Replace "_" with "-" right after space or closing brace.</p>
      <p>Replace "," with "&lt;" right after letter.</p>
      <p>Replace "." with "&gt;" right after letter if the line has "&lt;" before.</p>
      <p>Replace "1=" with "!= ".</p>
      <p>Replace "LETTER&lt;SPACE" with "LETTER,SPACE".</p>
